  storyText: 'The house is very large.  You walk along the wall until you reach a
    kind of alley.  At the end of the alley is a wooden cellar door.  Stooping above
    the door, you are surprised by the heat of the air.  It is as if a very hot fire
    burned on the other side.


    1.  Try to open the door.

    2.  Return to the front of the house.'
