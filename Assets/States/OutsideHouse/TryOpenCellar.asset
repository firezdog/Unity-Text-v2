  storyText: 'You spy a rusty copper handle on the surface of the trap door and move
    to grab it.  You reflexively pull your hand back and groan: it''s too hot.  What
    amazes you is that the wooden door hasn''t burst to flames from the heat of whatever
    burns on the other side.  You''ll have to find another way into the house.


    1. Go back to the main entrace.'
