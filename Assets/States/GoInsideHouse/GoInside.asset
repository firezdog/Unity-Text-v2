  storyText: 'The house is dark and musty.  You have entered what appears to be a
    foyer. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you perceive a patch of illumination
    at the end of a long hallway extending from the room.  You can also make out a
    staircase ascending into the shadows.  Somewhere far above you hear what sounds
    like a whisper, or maybe a moan.


    1. Investigate the sounds.

    2. Trace the source of the light.'
